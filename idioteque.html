<p>A Narrative & Production Analysis of Idioteque by Radiohead

  I’m not going to pretend like I’ve always understood what Thom Yorke was talking about in this song. I don’t know what he’s talking about in 89% of his songs. In my experience I almost never really understand what the majority of Radiohead track lyrics are saying until I take the time to sit down and obsessively listen. I’m talking sensory deprivation levels of listening. No distractions, eyes closed, just fully immersed in the music. I intentionally avoided looking up the lyrics to Idioteque for months just so I could make my own interpretation for this track/album.
  <br>
  <br>

  I love that about Radiohead’s music.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  
  Idioteque is a track that allures and captivates me as if it’s the first time I’ve heard it with every single replay. I hear new elements within this song every time I listen to it. Every single element of this track is meant to convey a message and build the world of the track.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  The first five to ten or so times I listened to this song I didn’t understand a more than 10 words of what Thom Yorke was trying to convey, let alone the overarching message; but I definitely felt it thanks to the production and vocal delivery.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  
  [I recommend listening to the track while reading]
  The track paints such a vivid image of what [I believe] the track is trying to convey. The track starts out with the kick damn near beating you upside the head yelling, “LISTEN TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY!!” (Also, this drum pattern is crazy). This is followed by feedback from what sounds like the sizzle & buzzing of an old crt monitor followed by a synth riff that sounds like a computer booting up (This makes sense considering the focus that Kid A & OK Computer had on the danger & impact that technology has on society).
  <br>
  <br>
  
  The brown noise, droning synth in the background and blowing air effects paint the scene of the song and bring the listener into the world: this scene is barren or even apocalyptic and set in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  This intro section begins with the sound of the computer booting up and ends with the sound of one booting down. I interpret this as the listener entering the “real [apocalyptic] world” (or the bad future of our world). The listener is further immersed into the world of the song after the introduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  Yorke’s lyrics come in for the first verse:
  <br>
  <br>
  
  “Who’s in the bunker? Who’s in the bunker?
  Women and children first, and the children first, and the children
  I’ll laugh until my head comes off”
  <br>
  <br>
  
  These lyrics confirmed the setting that I built in my head off the introduction instrumental (The first time I heard these lyrics I immediately thought of the intro sequence to Fallout 3, haha).
  <br>
  <br>
  
  The line about laughing until his head comes off is extremely vivid & distinct. It makes me wonder who this protagonist is and what could possibly make them laugh in this desolate future. It’s obvious that he’s laughing out of frustration/desperation (or maybe even insanity) because of the state of the world he lives in. This interpretation is all thanks to the juxtaposition to the instrumental that set the tone for this story. This line is incredible. So simple but effective.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  “Here I’m allowed
  Everything all of the time”
  <br>
  <br>
  
  The delivery of the chorus is such a stark jump from the previous one in terms of vocal delivery. It makes it sound like the protagonist (who was just laughing) is at a breaking point mentally and so they start crying (wailing even) out of desperation. One thing that always stood out to me is the way that the chorus always cuts itself off coming to & from the previous verse as it comes back up. I interpret this as a mental breaking point for our protagonist everytime it comes back around. That design choice was so intentional and is what I absolutely love about this track.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  The lyrics of the chorus can also be interpreted in two ways: “Here I’m alive” or “Here I’m allowed everything all of the time”. I’ve always heard the former but the latter makes perfect sense in the context of this song (if the message is interpreted as societies over-reliance on technology or the internet): Being allowed/exposed to everything [the internet/resources] all the time impacts society negatively. Overconsumption of technology and information is detrimental. This track was made in 2000 and its prediction has come true.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  The second verse removes the droning backing synth and directly places the lyrics (or the protagonist’s message at the forefront. These lyrics are intentionally very direct and easy to understand.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
  Let me hear both sides, let me hear both sides, let me hear both
  Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
  Throw him in the fire, throw him in the fire, throw him on the
  We’re not scaremongering
  This is really happening, happening
  We’re not scaremongering
  This is really happening, happening
  Mobiles skwerking, mobiles chirping
  Take the money and run, take the money and run, take the money
  <br>
  <br>
  
  ”̶I̶c̶e̶ ̶A̶g̶e̶ ̶c̶o̶m̶i̶n̶g̶”̶ ̶r̶e̶p̶r̶e̶s̶e̶n̶t̶s̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶B̶l̶u̶e̶ ̶S̶k̶y̶ ̶S̶t̶u̶d̶i̶o̶s̶ ̶m̶o̶v̶i̶e̶ ̶w̶o̶u̶l̶d̶ ̶b̶e̶ ̶c̶o̶m̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶o̶u̶t̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶t̶w̶o̶ ̶y̶e̶a̶r̶s̶ ̶w̶h̶i̶c̶h̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶a̶n̶ ̶i̶n̶c̶r̶e̶d̶i̶b̶l̶e̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶e̶s̶i̶g̶h̶t̶ ̶f̶r̶o̶m̶ ̶T̶h̶o̶m̶ ̶Y̶o̶r̶k̶e̶
  <br>
  <br>
  
  The lyrics “Ice Age coming” further reinforces the narrative and setting of the dystopian future caused by technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  The backing synth of the track is important. It distorts the lyrics (message) of the song. I think this could signify how technology tends to distort and segregate our messages and information even though it’s supposed to connect and inform us. This creates an information feedback in society the same way the synth creates feedback throughout the track.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  “This is really happening, happening, We’re not scaremongering” denounces the skeptics of the message that the protagonist is trying to spread. From this point on backing vocals enter the track and mumble some lyrics. I’ve always interpreted this as other people commenting on the protagonist’s attempts to inform them.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  “Mobiles skwerking, mobiles chirping, Take the money and run, Take our money and run, take our money” is another key set of lines. When I heard this in the context of the rest of the song’s themes my mind instantly jumped to some kind of large corporation. “Mobiles chirping” shows us that the people are willingly using the technology that the protagonist is fearing. This is fueling the corporations to produce more for consumption, further destroying the already desolate world. Beautifully brings the whole song full circle.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  The track ends with the lyrics “The first of the children” being repeated over and over again with all the feedback elements from the previous verses. I interpret this as the protagonist losing his battle of informing and giving up. “First of the children” sounds like it’s referring to kids being born into the latest wave of the information age (i.e. 2000s kids, like me).
  <br>
  <br>
  
  Idioteque by Radiohead is a phenomenal track.
